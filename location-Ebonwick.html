      The city of Ebonwick was built at the base of a potentially active volcano and is truly a state-of-the-art urban phenomenon. Its elegance is matched by the backdrop of rich, luscious fields which have helped shape the city to what it is today.
    </p>
    <p class="col-4">
        The trade resources these fields brought were of great importance, but they were also influential when it came to architectural designs as the vast majority of buildings incorporate grass as part of their architecture in order to continue the luscious aesthetic of the fields around them.

    <p class="col-4">
      The skyline is growing with impressive skyscrapers and there is no place on earth with anything like this. Life is great in Ebonwick and it has attracted a lot of attention. Various cultures have left their mark not just on the city's development, but also upon the city's identity. What historically was a city of few cultures has grown into a new culture of variety and it's this that unites the 3 million people to this day.
