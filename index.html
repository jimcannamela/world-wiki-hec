      1. Start with a generic concept for your world. Is it a wasteland? A paradise? A giant ball of cheese?

      2. Once you have a good generic idea, come up with a name for your world and fill in the blank below.

      Tip: If you have trouble coming up with ideas, you are free to use random generators online. Here are a couple to try:
      https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/planet-descriptions.php
      https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/planet-names.php
      https://codebeautify.org/random-environment-generator
      https://www.random.org/

      Feel free to use generated names and text blocks if it helps move your group forward. If none of the ones above are what you are looking for, some quick googling for "random X generator" usually yields some useful tools.

        This could be a government travel bureau, a corporation of some sort, or even an individual in your world.
        The important part is this has to be a form used to contact this entity.
