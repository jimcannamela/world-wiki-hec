      The Fungal Grove has a rich history and is steeped in legend and mythology. It is said that the grove was once home to a great civilization that was destroyed by an ancient catastrophe, leaving only ruins and relics behind. Despite this, the forest has become a symbol of hope and rebirth for the people of the surrounding areas, who see the fungi's ability to break down and recycle even the most toxic materials as a symbol of the resilience of life.
